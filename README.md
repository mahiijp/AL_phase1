## Introduction

This project uses machine learning techniques to measure energy consumption for a specific device or system. By analyzing historical data and utilizing predictive models, it aims to provide insights into energy usage patterns and optimize energy efficiency. The code can be customized to suit various applications, such as home energy monitoring, industrial equipment, or IoT devices.

## Data Source

The data used for energy consumption measurement is sourced from( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption). This dataset includes [brief description of the dataset, such as the type of measurements, the time period covered, and any relevant attributes].

Data Sample:

| Timestamp           | Energy Consumption (kWh) | Other Relevant Attributes |
|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| 2023-01-01 00:00:00 | 12.5                     | ...                       |
| 2023-01-01 00:15:00 | 12.6                     | ...                       |
| 2023-01-01 00:30:00 | 12.7                     | ...                       |
| ...                 | ...                      | ...                       |


The dataset provides the historical energy consumption data needed for training and testing machine learning models.
